**Launch Your Own Online TV Station**

*Simple steps to get your swaigtv + swaigelock platform live*

---

## What You're Building

Your own online TV station with:
- Visual effects and animations
- Secure broadcasting with swaigelock
- Connect to the swaigtv network
- Enterprise-grade security scanning

## What You Need

- Computer with internet
- [Node.js 18.17+](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed  
- Text editor (VS Code works great)
- GitHub account (personal, not corporate)

---

## Step 1: Get Your TV Station Code

### Fork and Clone from GitHub
1. Go to `https://github.com/swaigwar/-wagTV` 
2. Click "Fork" to copy it to your personal GitHub account
3. Clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/-wagTV.git
cd -wagTV
npm install
```

**Alternative Git Hosts:** GitLab, Codeberg, SourceHut if you want other options!

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template if it exists
cp .env.example .env.local

# Initialize quantum modules
npm run quantum:init
```

Fill in your `.env.local` file with any required API keys or settings.

---

## Step 2: Start Your TV Station

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000` - your TV station is live locally!

Test everything works:
```bash
npm test              # Run tests
npm run typecheck     # Check TypeScript
npm run lint         # Check code style
```

---

## Step 3: Security Setup

```bash
npm run security:scan
```

This runs your DIY enterprise security checks including:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis  
- Configuration validation
- Real-time threat monitoring setup

---

## Make It Yours

### Your TV Station Name
Edit `package.json` - change the name to your station name.

### Your Content
- Add your images to `assets/` folder
- Edit `app/page.tsx` for your homepage
- Update colors and fonts in `tailwind.config.js`

### Connect to swaigtv Network
Your station automatically connects to other swaigtv stations once deployed.

4. Clone your GitHub repo on the server
5. Run: `docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d`
6. Point your domain's DNS to the droplet IP
7. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt: `certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com`

**Option B: DigitalOcean App Platform (Managed)**
1. Create new App in DO App Platform
2. Connect to your GitHub repository
3. Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
4. Run command: `npm start`
5. Add environment variables in settings
6. Deploy automatically with SSL included

**Option C: Any VPS Provider**
- Look for Node.js 18+ support
- Reasonable pricing (usually $5-20/month)
- Good documentation and support

### DIY Enterprise Security
Your swaigelock security runs automatically once deployed:
