# SWAIG TV AI Safety Guidelines

## Introduction

This document outlines the AI safety measures implemented in the SWAIG TV Quantum Simulation Platform. These guidelines are designed to ensure the ethical, secure, and responsible use of AI technologies within our platform.

## Core AI Safety Principles

Our AI safety approach is built on four key pillars:

1. **Security** - Protecting systems from malicious actors and unintended behaviors
2. **Robustness** - Ensuring AI systems perform reliably under various conditions
3. **Alignment** - Making sure AI behavior aligns with human values and intentions
4. **Transparency** - Providing clear understanding of how AI systems function

## Implemented Safety Measures

### 1. Input Safety

- **Prompt Injection Prevention**
  - All user inputs are sanitized to prevent prompt manipulation
  - Pattern-matching against known injection techniques
  - Length limits to prevent overwhelming the system

- **Input Validation**
  - Type checking and format validation
  - Content filtering for harmful inputs
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### 2. Output Safety

- **Content Filtering**
  - Output screening for harmful content
  - Automated detection of biased or misleading information
  - Human-in-the-loop review for sensitive operations

- **Output Sanitization**
  - HTML sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks
  - Removal of personally identifiable information (PII)
  - Format validation before display

### 3. Model Safety

- **Model Selection Criteria**
  - Use of models that have undergone safety alignment training
  - Preference for models with proven track records
  - Regular updates to maintain security

- **Parameter Controls**
  - Temperature settings to manage output randomness
  - Top-k and top-p filtering to improve output quality
  - Maximum token limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### 4. System Safety

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Per-user and global rate limits
  - Graduated throttling for suspected abuse
  - Monitoring of usage patterns

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Secure API key management
  - Role-based access controls
  - Audit logging of all AI operations

- **Monitoring & Alerting**
  - Real-time monitoring for anomalous behavior
  - Alerting on safety threshold violations
  - Usage metrics for identifying abuse patterns

## Testing & Verification

### Red Team Testing

Our AI systems undergo regular red team testing to identify potential vulnerabilities:

- Prompt injection attacks
- Data poisoning attempts
- Robustness under adversarial inputs
- Edge case handling
- Performance under load

### Continuous Improvement

We maintain a cycle of continuous improvement:

1. Monitor system behavior and user feedback
2. Identify potential safety issues
3. Implement and test improvements
4. Deploy updates with careful validation

## Incident Response

In the event of an AI safety incident:

1. The affected system will be isolated
2. A security investigation will be conducted
3. Appropriate mitigations will be applied
4. Transparency report will be published
