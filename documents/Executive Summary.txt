## Executive Summary

Phase 1 (“Big Bang” Alpha 1.0) demonstrates that **SWAIG TV already has a production‑grade technical foundation and a compelling creative identity, but the flagship Big Bang experience is still a stub**. The codebase is cleanly organized (Next.js 14 + Three.js + WASM), security‑hardened, and fully containerised for easy DigitalOcean deployment; visuals are polished and on‑brand, and the cosmology narrative is impressively detailed. However, the “Begin Journey” button is not wired up, interactivity is minimal, and there is no public demo URL yet. Priority next steps are (1) implementing the full Big Bang cinematic or interactive sequence, (2) adding basic user controls and a low‑power mode, and (3) standing up at least one live demo instance to gather non‑technical user feedback. With those gaps closed, the project can shift from an impressive developer preview to a broadly engaging AI‑powered media platform.
