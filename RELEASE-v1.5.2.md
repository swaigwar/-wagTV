## Public Release Summary (WagTV v1.5.2)

WagTV v1.5.2, codenamed "Quantum Fractals", is now live as an open-source project ‚Äì bringing dazzling fractal visuals to the community alongside crucial behind-the-scenes upgrades. This release is a significant milestone: not only does it showcase new fractal art inspired by the Infinite Jester series, but it also marks the first version of WagTV available to the public with a strong emphasis on security and stability. Users can explore the generative fractal content knowing that the application has been rigorously vetted for safety.

In v1.5.2 we tightened the ship on all fronts. The codebase was cleaned and fortified with multiple security enhancements (e.g. sensitive settings have been moved out of code into secure configs, and numerous stability checks were added). We've also expanded and polished our documentation ‚Äì making it easier for anyone to get started with WagTV and understand its features.

Whether you're an artist, a developer, or just curious, WagTV v1.5.2 invites you to dive into a universe of evolving fractal patterns with confidence. This release balances creative innovation with robust engineering, laying a solid foundation for future updates. Thank you for joining us on this journey, and stay tuned for more exciting developments in the WagTV saga!

## üîí Security Enhancements

### Critical Security Hardening
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) Hardening**: Removed unsafe-eval and unsafe-inline directives, restricted img-src and connect-src for enhanced XSS protection
- **HTML Sanitization**: Replaced custom sanitizer with industry-standard DOMPurify integration
- **Configuration Security**: Eliminated duplicate next.config.mjs file to prevent config drift vulnerabilities
- **Secret Management**: Removed sensitive .env.local from git tracking, enforced environment variable usage
- **Automated Security Scanning**: Added GitHub CodeQL workflow for continuous security monitoring

### Security Best Practices Implemented
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized before processing
- **Rate Limiting**: 60 requests/minute, 1000/hour per user protection
- **Content Filtering**: PG-13 compliance with SwagTVContentFilter (139+ blocked terms)
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages prevent information leakage
- **Dependency Security**: Updated all packages to latest secure versions
