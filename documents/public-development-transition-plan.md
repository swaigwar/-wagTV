# Public Development Transition Plan - v1.5 Fractal

**SWAIG TV - End of Public Development Due Diligence**

*Integrated plan from Claude Code + o3 pro collaboration for responsible open source transition*

---

## 🎯 Objective

Professionally transition SWAIG TV from public to private development at v1.5 fractal milestone, ensuring community has secure, testable code while maintaining transparent communication about the development path forward.

---

## ✅ Complete Due Diligence Checklist

### Phase 1: Repository Security Setup

**☐ 1.1 Create Signed Release (SemVer Compliant)**
```bash
# Create proper SemVer pre-release tag
git tag -s v1.5.0-alpha-secfix -m "v1.5.0 Alpha Security Milestone"
git verify-tag v1.5.0-alpha-secfix
gh release create v1.5.0-alpha-secfix --title "v1.5.0 Alpha Security Milestone" --generate-notes --prerelease
```

**Note**: Using SemVer pre-release format ensures package managers handle it correctly

**☐ 1.2 Add SECURITY.md**
```markdown
# Security Policy

**Supported versions** – Only the `v1.5-fractal` tag is considered stable for testing.  
**Reporting** – Please use GitHub's *Private vulnerability report* or email security@swaggyverse.com.  
Do **not** open public issues for security bugs.

**Response SLA** – Acknowledgment within 48 hours for security matters.

## What to Test
- Content filtering in Swagelok Sync
- Rate limiting on AI queries  
- XSS prevention in text inputs
- Particle count validation (2-100 range)

## Expected Security Behaviors
- Inappropriate content shows "Content filtered" message
- Rate limiting displays "Please wait" warnings
- Script tags are escaped, not executed
- Particle counts clamped to safe ranges
```

**☐ 1.3 Create Public Security Advisory**
- Open Security → Advisories → New draft advisory
- Affected: <= v1.4-alpha
- Fixed: v1.5-fractal  
- Severity: Low (DoS / missing GPU re-init)
- Credits: "Community testers"

### Phase 2: Visual Communication

**☐ 2.1 Update README with Banner & Professional Badges**
```markdown
---
➡️ **Public milestone frozen at [v1.5.0-alpha-secfix](https://github.com/swaigwar/-wagTV/releases/tag/v1.5.0-alpha-secfix)** – try it & report bugs. Active dev is now private.
