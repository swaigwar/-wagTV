   - Integrated with ESLint security rules

## Technical Details

### Rate Limiter Implementation

The rate limiter uses a two-level tracking system:
1. A request log that maintains timestamps of all requests
2. A cleanup mechanism that filters out expired timestamps
3. Separate tracking for different users and models
4. Configurable limits with reasonable defaults

```typescript
class RateLimiter {
  private maxRequestsPerMinute: number;
  private maxRequestsPerHour: number;
  private requestLog: Map<string, number[]>;

  constructor(options: RateLimiterOptions = {}) {
    this.maxRequestsPerMinute = options.maxRequestsPerMinute || 60;
    this.maxRequestsPerHour = options.maxRequestsPerHour || 1000;
    this.requestLog = new Map<string, number[]>();
  }

  check(userId: string, modelId: string = 'default'): boolean {
    const now = Date.now();
    const key = `${userId}:${modelId}`;
    
    // Get and filter requests within the time window
    const userRequests = this.requestLog.get(key) || [];
    const oneHourAgo = now - (60 * 60 * 1000);
    const filteredRequests = userRequests.filter(timestamp => timestamp > oneHourAgo);
    
    // Check hour and minute limits
    const oneMinuteAgo = now - (60 * 1000);
    const requestsLastMinute = filteredRequests.filter(timestamp => timestamp > oneMinuteAgo);
    
    if (requestsLastMinute.length >= this.maxRequestsPerMinute || 
        filteredRequests.length >= this.maxRequestsPerHour) {
      return false;
    }
    
    // Record this request
    filteredRequests.push(now);
    this.requestLog.set(key, filteredRequests);
    
    return true;
  }
}
```

### AI Sanitization Implementation

The AI sanitizer implements multiple layers of protection:

1. **Content Detection**: Using pattern matching to identify potentially harmful content
2. **Length Validation**: Preventing excessively long outputs
3. **HTML Sanitization**: Restricting allowed HTML tags and attributes
4. **Safe Rendering**: Providing utilities for safe rendering in React

```typescript
function sanitizeAiOutput(content: string, options: SanitizerOptions = {}): string {
  if (!content) return '';
  
  // Merge options with defaults
  const mergedOptions = { ...defaultOptions, ...options };
  
  // Truncate if needed
  if (mergedOptions.maxLength && content.length > mergedOptions.maxLength) {
    content = content.substring(0, mergedOptions.maxLength);
  }
  
  // Check for harmful content
  if (mergedOptions.checkForHarmfulContent && detectHarmfulContent(content)) {
    return '[Content filtered for safety reasons]';
  }
  
  // Sanitize HTML
  return sanitizeHtml(content, mergedOptions.allowedTags || []);
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple layers of validation and sanitization
   - Fail-safe defaults for all configurations
   - Comprehensive error handling to prevent unexpected behavior

2. **Safe Input Handling**
   - Type validation for all user inputs
   - Boundary checking for numeric parameters
   - Pattern matching for potential malicious content

3. **Safe Output Processing**
   - Content filtering before rendering
   - Sanitization of HTML content
   - Secure usage of React's dangerouslySetInnerHTML

4. **Resource Protection**
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Quota management for fair resource allocation
   - Logging of potential security issues

## Conclusion

The implemented AI safety measures provide a comprehensive security framework for the SWAIG TV project's AI components. By addressing input validation, output sanitization, rate limiting, and security scanning, the system is now better protected against common AI-related security risks while maintaining functionality and performance.

## Component Organization

To ensure clarity and maintainability, we've implemented the following organizational improvements:

1. **Optimized Components**
   - `optimized-quantum-visualizer.tsx` is now the primary component for quantum visualization
   - Includes all safety measures, performance optimizations, and expanded configuration options

2. **Legacy Component Management**
   - Created `/components/swaig/legacy/` directory to archive older component versions
   - Moved original `quantum-visualizer.tsx` to the legacy folder
   - Added documentation in the legacy folder explaining migration path

3. **Test Updates**
   - Updated all tests to reference the optimized components
   - Maintained backward compatibility for existing implementations

This organization ensures that developers have a clear understanding of which components to use for new development while preserving the history and functionality of older implementations.
