SwagTV and Horrorverse: Safety, Structure, and Split Access Design Plan

Objective:
Ensure that SwagTV remains a safe, inclusive, creative PG-13 environment while containing mature or extreme horror content separately through the "Horrorverse" website. The approach emphasizes consent, fast opt-out, and distinct barriers between experiences.

1. SwagTV Safety and Content Guidelines (PG-13):

Core Audience: General public including teens and young adults; safe for family viewing.

Rating Standard: Conservative PG-13 (think The Simpsons or 90s MTV, not borderline R-rated).

Strict Prohibitions:

No nudity

No explicit sexual content

No extreme violence

No grotesque or deeply disturbing imagery

No depictions of underage or questionable age scenarios

Instant Opt-Out:

All video content must include a visible and instantly accessible stop/exit button.

Users must never be trapped or forced to view disturbing or non-consensual material.

Moderation & Filters:

AI filters + human moderation to flag and remove inappropriate submissions.

Flagging system for users to report content.

Content must be pre-approved or pass trust-based tier moderation before publication.

2. Horrorverse (18+ Only):

Access Protocols:

Completely separate domain (e.g., horrorverse.com)

No links or portals from SwagTV to Horrorverse

Age-gated with legal disclaimers, clear warnings, and parental guidance locks

Intended Audience: Adults 18+

Permissible Content:

Creepy, dark, or grotesque user-generated horror

Genre-based campfire stories, simulations, short films, AI-generated thrillers

No illegal or exploitative material whatsoever

Curation & Control:

Clearly labeled content warnings (gore, psychological, disturbing themes, etc.)

Opt-out / exit tools always available

Encourage artistic or atmospheric horror over shock value

3. Swagelok Technology (Control Architecture):

Dual-Channel Infrastructure:

One codebase but split into two independently deployed websites

Shared core tech (e.g., story builders, AI visuals) with separate policy overlays

Permissions System:

Consent-locked toggles per user

All submissions go through a pipeline tagged by content type, with separate queues

Transparency and ReadMe:

A shared doc outlining the split system, purpose, boundaries, and moderation policy

Plain-language version for general users

Closing Notes:
This structure is designed to protect SwagTV’s accessibility and welcoming tone, while providing space for darker artistic expression through Horrorverse. The red line between them must be strictly enforced through both design and policy. Users should never feel unsafe or tricked into crossing into mature content zones without clear choice and control.
