# Big Bang Video Guide

This document outlines a two-part deliverable for creating a cinematic Big Bang video with Sora.

## 1. State of the Art Big Bang (mid-2025)

| Cosmological era | What happened | Most recent observational clues (2024-mid-2025) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| t < 10^-36 s | Quantum origin & inflation | A seething quantum field underwent exponential inflation, stretching sub-atomic fluctuations to macroscopic scales and seeding the CMB. The BICEP/Keck/BK18 CMB-polarization analysis tightened the upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio to r < 0.019, ruling out many "large-field" inflation models but still leaving room for weaker primordial gravitational-wave backgrounds. |
| 10^-36 s – 10^-6 s | Baryogenesis & quark–gluon plasma | Inflaton energy reheated the Universe to 10^27 K; matter/antimatter asymmetry froze in; quarks and gluons condensed into protons & neutrons. The Large Hadron Collider's heavy-ion runs (2023-24) mapped quark–gluon plasma viscosity, constraining early-Universe QCD parameters (reviewed in Phys. Rev. Lett., 2024). |
| 1 s – 3 min | Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) | Fusion forged ~75% H, 25% He, trace D, ⁷Li. Combined Planck 2018 + ACT DR6 + JWST deuterium surveys show BBN predictions still match abundances to <2%. |
| 380,000 yr | Recombination & CMB | Electrons bound to nuclei; photons decoupled, forming the 2.725 K CMB backdrop. Four independent analyses confirm subtle CMB lensing and Sunyaev–Zel'dovich corrections now dominate the error budget in ΛCDM fits. |
| 100–500 Myr | Cosmic Dawn & Re-ionisation | First stars and black holes lit up, ionising hydrogen fog. JWST keeps rewriting the timetable—JADES-GS-z13-1 (z=13) produces bright Lyman-α only 330 Myr after the Bang, and record-holder MoM z14 (z=14.44) appears at 280 Myr, implying even earlier star formation. |
| 500 Myr – 1 Gyr | Early galaxies grow fast | Massive galaxies assembled sooner than theory allowed. Three "red-monster" galaxies already Milky-Way-scale by 700 Myr challenge hierarchical-merger models. |
| 13.8 Gyr → today | Large-scale structure & expansion tension | Dark-energy-driven expansion accelerates; galaxies form a cosmic web. DESI-II's 800,000-galaxy 3-D map (released June 2025) refines the baryon-acoustic peak and sharpens—but does not resolve—the 5σ "Hubble tension" between local-distance ladders and early-Universe fits. |

Take-away: The canonical ΛCDM Big-Bang picture remains robust, but inflationary physics, the timing of re-ionisation, the efficiency of early galaxy assembly, and the exact expansion rate are all in flux—perfect drama for a Sora-generated film.

## 2. Ready-to-paste Sora Prompt

**Prompt title:** "From Quantum Tremor to Cosmic Dawn — an ultra-cinematic Big Bang experience"

**Scene 1 – Prelude (0–10 s)**
- Camera: Extreme macro shot inside a pitch-black quantum foam. Sub-atomic fluctuations pop in and out, glowing faint violet.
- Mood & FX: Ethereal ambience; soft particle depth of field; subtle lens-whisper.

**Scene 2 – Inflation (10–15 s)**
- Transition: Fluctuations balloon instantaneously; spacetime grid stretches faster than light. Use volumetric motion-blur ribbons radiating in 360°.
- Palette: Electric cyan & white highlights fading into infrared redshift.

**Scene 3 – Quark–Gluon Symphony (15–20 s)**
- Camera: Pull back to reveal a fireball 10^27 K. Swarming quarks (tiny luminous sparks) swirl in a translucent, shimmering plasma. Occasional matter–antimatter annihilation flashes.
- Physics note: Hint at baryogenesis by rendering slight surplus of amber particles over teal antiparticles.

**Scene 4 – First Nuclei (20–25 s)**
- Temperature gauge overlay cools below 10^9 K. Light coalesces around forming protons & neutrons, then snaps into helium nuclei. Include dynamic 3-D HUD annotations ("^4He 25%", "D 0.002%").

**Scene 5 – Recombination & CMB Birth (25–32 s)**
- Immersive first-person drift through a fog that suddenly becomes transparent. Behind the camera an all-sky warm orange/teal glow freezes into the uniform CMB, then rapidly redshifts to faint microwave blue.

**Scene 6 – Dark Ages to Cosmic Dawn (32–42 s)**
- Time-lapse star-field: black sky sprinkled with white noise gradually sparks into Population III star clusters. Show ionisation bubbles expanding as bluish halos, merging into a pinkish nebula lattice.

**Scene 7 – JWST Era Peek (42–50 s)**
- Stylised telescope aperture iris wipes open. Highlight JADES-GS-z13-1 and MoM z14 as bright UV nodes, label redshifts "z=13" & "z=14.4". Surround them with faint Lyman-α rings.

**Scene 8 – Cosmic Web & Hubble Tension (50–60 s)**
- Cinematic pull-out spanning billions of light-years: golden filaments connect shimmering galaxy clusters. Two semi-transparent graph overlays show H₀ = 73 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹ (local) vs H₀ = 67 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹ (CMB). Numbers pulse red to underline the "crisis".

**Visual style & specs:** IMAX-grade, photorealistic CGI fused with scientific-data-driven particle simulations; 70 mm grain for warmth; HDR10; smooth 60 fps; 8K render.

**Sound design (optional):** Deep infra-bass "inflation boom", rising choral pads during recombination, sparkling arpeggios for first stars.

**Guidance:** Prioritise physically accurate scale changes, seamless time-lapse morphs, and volumetric lighting; avoid copyrighted NASA imagery—generate original renders inspired by Planck & JWST palettes.

### How to iterate with Sora
1. Start short (≤15 s)—focus on Scenes 1–3. Check motion-blur handling of inflation and quark-gluon shader.
2. Lock colour language—establish a cool→warm→cool gradient matching temperature drops.
3. Layer scientific annotations only after the core visuals feel smooth; use unobtrusive HUD elements that can be toggled on/off.
4. Refine tempo—inflation must feel instantaneous (<0.5 s on screen) whereas cosmic dawn can breathe.
5. Final pass—add ambient soundtrack, subtitles, and your Swaggyverse title card.

Using the timeline above ensures your video remains both spectacular and scientifically up to date, embodying everything we currently know—and still puzzle over—about the real Big Bang.
