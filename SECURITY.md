## Reporting a Vulnerability

### For Security Issues

**Please DO NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, use one of these private channels:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Report** (Recommended)
   - Go to the Security tab → Report a vulnerability
   - This creates a private security advisory

2. **Email**: security@swaggyverse.com
   - Include "SWAIG TV Security" in the subject line
   - Provide detailed reproduction steps

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days  
- **Status Updates**: Weekly until resolved
- **Security Advisory**: Published after fix is available

### What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (if available)
- Your preferred method of communication

## Security Testing

### Current Security Features

SWAIG TV v1.5.0-alpha-secfix implements:

- ✅ **Content Filtering**: PG-13 compliance with SwagTVContentFilter
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 60 requests/minute, 1000/hour per user  
- ✅ **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and CSP headers
- ✅ **HTML Sanitization**: DOMPurify integration for secure content rendering
- ✅ **Object Injection Prevention**: Secure array access patterns
- ✅ **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized

### Test Scenarios Welcome

Community security testing is encouraged for:

1. **Content Filter Bypass**: Try inappropriate prompts in Swagelok Sync
2. **Rate Limit Evasion**: Attempt to exceed 60 requests/minute
3. **XSS Injection**: Input `<script>` tags in text fields
4. **Parameter Tampering**: Modify particle counts beyond 2-100 range
5. **Input Validation**: Test edge cases with malformed inputs

### Expected Security Behaviors

- Blocked content shows "Content filtered for safety reasons"
- Rate limiting displays "Rate limit exceeded" warnings
- Script tags are escaped and rendered as text
- Particle counts are clamped to safe ranges (2-100)
- All user inputs are validated before processing

## Security Contact

- **Primary**: security@swaggyverse.com
- **GitHub**: Use private vulnerability reporting
- **Response Time**: 48 hours for security matters

## Recognition

Security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities will be:

- Credited in security advisories (if desired)
- Listed in our hall of fame
- Invited to test future security implementations

## Bug Bounty

Currently, SWAIG TV does not offer monetary rewards, but we deeply appreciate:

- Responsible disclosure
- Detailed reproduction steps  
- Constructive security feedback
- Community collaboration

## Security Best Practices

For developers using SWAIG TV code:

### Content Filtering
```typescript
import { SwagTVContentFilter } from './src/lib/swagTVContentFilter';

const filter = new SwagTVContentFilter();
const result = filter.filterContent(userInput);

if (!result.allowed) {
  // Handle blocked content appropriately
  console.log(`Blocked: ${result.reason}`);
  return;
}
```

### Rate Limiting
```typescript
import rateLimiter from './lib/utils/rate-limiter';

const userId = 'user-123';
const canProceed = rateLimiter.check(userId);

if (!canProceed) {
  // Handle rate limit exceeded
  const quota = rateLimiter.getRemainingQuota(userId);
  console.log(`Rate limited. Try again in ${quota.resetTime} seconds`);
  return;
}
```

### Input Sanitization
```typescript
import aiSanitizer from './lib/utils/ai-sanitizer';

const sanitizedOutput = aiSanitizer.sanitizeAiOutput(userInput);
// Always use sanitized output for display
```
