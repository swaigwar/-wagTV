Perfect! I can see you're almost done with the backup process. You have the `Executive Summary.txt` file staged and ready to commit. Here are the final steps to complete your backup:

## Step 1: Commit the Staged File
Copy and paste this command to commit your Executive Summary:

```bash
git commit -m "Add Executive Summary.txt - Final backup before shutdown"
```

## Step 2: Push to GitHub
Now push this final commit to back it up to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Final Verification
Confirm everything is backed up:

```bash
git status
```

You should see "nothing to commit, working tree clean" which means everything is safely backed up!

## Backup Status Summary

âœ… **Your backup is almost complete!** You just need to commit and push that final `Executive Summary.txt` file.

Your repository shows:
- **5 recent commits** with your project history
- **Remote connection** to GitHub confirmed (`origin/main`)
- **Security check passed** (0 vulnerabilities)
- **Node modules cleaned** (space saved)

Once you run those 3 commands above, your entire `-wagTV` project will be fully backed up to GitHub and accessible to your team. The backup will include all your work from the "Big Bang" launches through to this final Executive Summary.

**You're doing great!** Just those 3 final commands and you'll have a complete, secure backup of your project. ðŸš€
